            Understanding best practices - understanding the importance of
            writing code one step at a time and also testing your code
            throughout writing it to ensure functionality to achieve the end
            result. I have found that I am able to be more consistent with the code I write and am more
            knowledgeable about the purpose for each line of code. I have been
            able to apply these practices to SQL, Java, and JavaScript.

            Learner‚Äôs mindset - taking CSIS 1430; I have really enjoyed my time in CSIS 1430 with Professor Elizabeth and also watching Jeff Stone videos! I did not have any experience when it came to the programming aspect of the class, as I had not had a great experience in my Introduction to Programming class, so the JavaScript was probably the hardest part for me. However I really did enjoy the class, and the challenge that the JavaScript brought was also enjoyable. Since we were only meeting up one time a week for an hour and such a short semester we didn't really go into depth with a lot of the things, which I would have liked to do, but it also gave me the opportunity to go and learn on my own a bit, which was also enjoyable. I would say that out of all the courses I've taken so far at SLCC, this is probably my favorite class so far.

            Thinking outside the box - being someone who thinks very literally,
            all my life I have felt it was a weakness or disadvantage. Learning
            Javascript and Java has made me realize that it is, in fact, a strength and
            can help me look at concepts or problems in a more simpler way and
            avoid overthinking them. Utilizing my natural way of thinking as a
            strength has improved my communication skills in contributing to
            constructive conversation with peers and having more confidence to
            share innovative ideas.
